# Who We Are
We are a group of passionate and diverse set of individuals committed to achieving global sustainability and a healthy business environment where technological development, insttitutional change, and social impact live in harmony.



* ![Ivo_abbatek_profile_pic.jpg](/figs/Ivo_abbatek_profile_pic.jpg)
Ivo is a hydrologist with experience in earth data analytics and machine learning. Projects under his belt have sought to provide information on the interaction between surface controls and spatio-temporal variability of sub-surface hydrologic processes. In his work, he uses a combination of experimental, theoretical, numerical, and computational methods to address these hydrologic processes. In addition to his academic side, Ivo uses his acquired skills as a seasoned entrepreneur having participated in a number of hackathons solving problems that range from fintech to public health.


* ![Sam.png](/figs/Sam.png)
Sam is a business development and communications specialist. While completing a master’s degree at the University of Winnipeg, Sam began literature for environmental and medical science journals. A resume in science writing led to him founding 204 Communications to specialize in environmental reporting and sustainability initiatives. Sam is a co-founder of the AbbaTek Group and at the same time holds the role of the Communications & Outreach Coordinator at the University of Manitoba's Centre for Earth Observation Science.

# What We Do

Our goal is to teach researchers the fundamental skills to improve and automate their workflows which will increase their productivity, the reproducibility of their research and eventually the quality of their work.
We do this by teaching two day workshops, where students learn how to automate tasks using the Unix shell, how to track and share work using version control, and how to write software in Python, R, or MATLAB that is readable, reusable, and reliable.

The teaching material of the Carpentries projects (Software Carpentries, Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry) are being developed by the Carpentries communities and freely available under an open access license and our instructors and helpers are volunteers.

We encourage interested workshop participants to support future workshops as helpers and/or becoming Carpentries Instructors themselves. 

We are dedicated to the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) to providing a welcoming, inclusive and supportive environment for all people.
