# Who We Are
We are a team of Software-Carpentry Instructors and Helpers at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) who are organizing and offering Software-Carpentry and in the future Data-Carpentry, Library-Carpentry and HPC-Carpentry workshops at MUN.

# What We Do

Our goal is to teach researchers the fundamental skills to improve and automate their workflows which will increase their productivity, the reproducibility of their research and eventually the quality of their work.
We do this by teaching two day workshops, where students learn how to automate tasks using the Unix shell, how to track and share work using version control, and how to write software in Python, R, or MATLAB that is readable, reusable, and reliable.

The teaching material of the Carpentries projects (Software Carpentries, Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry) are being developed by the Carpentries communities and freely available under an open access license and our instructors and helpers are volunteers.

We encourage interested workshop participants to support future workshops as helpers and/or becoming Carpentries Instructors themselves. 

We are dedicated to the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) to providing a welcoming, inclusive and supportive environment for all people.
