# What We Do

Regardless of the type of business you run, you cannot operate to your fullest potential without exploring the benefits of artificial and human intelligence. Our augmented decision support business intelligence platform can take your business to that next level. We believe every business has an impact to the community and environment in which it operates. What is yours?    

As one of our priority focus areas, AbbaTek is committed in developing tools to help understand complex water resources issues such as the case of emerging contaminants in freshwater like microplastics.  Unfortunately, budget cycles, limited human resources, and key stake holders paasively partake in the supply chain resulting in a sustainability gap for such tools. Early this year, AbbaTek joined the Aquahacking Lake Winnipeg challenge competition designed for pre-and-early-stage startups to address environmental problems related to freshwater. Participants are provided with some financial and mentorship support to help guide their solution development. AbbaTek is among the top five teams that qualified to the finals of this competition slated to take place on October 17th , 2020 and will be presenting our solution to the problem of microplastics in freshwater.
